# Conclusion

This initial Yeast sample sequencing on GridION based on a  library preparation with the Lexogen kit validates this later as efficient in producing full-length transcripts from total RNA.

However, the large number of unclassified or mixed-type isoforms found in this study ask the question whether this is a normal situation in yeast or suggests artefacts during cDNA production.

The analysis of the same library with Illumina and the specific inspection of multigenic transcripts might partly answer this point.
