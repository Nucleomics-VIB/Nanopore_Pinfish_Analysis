# Aim

A cDNA library was prepared from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S288c) total RNA using the **'Teloprime v2 kit'** (https://www.lexogen.com/teloprime-full-length-cdna-amplification/). mRNA was processed and amplified to lead to a nanopore cDNA library loaded on a single GridION flow-cell. RNA QC and run metrics are not reported here but were all in specs (CVD).

This sequencing experiment aims at defining the yield and analyse the content of a cDNA run in order to evaluate whether this approach is applicable to RNA expression studies and potentially differential transcriptome analysis. The sample used for this pilot experiment was prepared in large quantities after growth on a rich medium. A second pilot experiment will be needed to evaluate the reproducibility of such sequencing applied to several replicates and two different growth conditions.
